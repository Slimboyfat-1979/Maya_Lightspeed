<!--<p>A strong partnership founded Maya Music in 2011 and it remains solid between the two co-founders,-->
<!--    directors and lifetime friends Becks Cole & Deo Bohn, together the duo have overcome many obstacles in both their business and personal lives, despite this the business partners know the power of optimism, trust, integrity & doing what’s right, not just for each other, but for the entire team at-->

<!--    How it all began, from modest beginnings-->
<!---->
<!--    heart, soul, passion for music and a need to put food on the table, drove Deo to teach a handful of guitar students in a-->
<!--    small upstairs room on Dee Street, Invercargill. Needing enough students to cover the rent, plus earn a modest wage,-->
<!--    Becks supported Deo between her other jobs by hand delivering flyers that advertised music lessons,-->
<!--    this simple yet effective initiative increased  lessons and with it a need, a need, for guitars,-->
<!--    with Deo’s knack for sourcing a great deal, the pair bought second hand guitars, cleaned and-->
<!--    serviced them, then sold them on for a small profit and in return they had happy customers, a win win, something you always want in business.-->
<!---->
<!--    Struggles, setback, success, the ongoing cycle of operating a small business...-->
