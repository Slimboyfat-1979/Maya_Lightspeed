                    Dom is best known for his flair on the drums, an instrument he has pursued passionately for over 25 years. He has been a music tutor at Maya music since the beginning of 2022 for Piano, Guitar and Drums.
                    Dom started his musical journey at a young age. Being the son of esteemed Keyboardist and Music educator, Liam Ryan (The Narcs, Midge Marsden, Tauranga Jazz fest etc),
                    Dom's ears were tuned to music early on, earning him the Johnny Corban Music award from Berkeley Intermediate in 2001 for his contributions to the school with their orchestra and band show cases.
                    Continuing his music studies throughout High school, NCEA performances garnered merit and excellence for composition and rock/metal performances through senior years 2004-2006.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dom has studied at MAINZ (Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand) in 2007 after which he pursued expanding his skillset in his musical career,
                    Gaining notoriety over the upper North island as a performer through his later teens and early 20's, Dom found himself being sought after in the Waikato music scene. At one point he played drums in at least 8 different ensembles (4 original groups and 4 cover bands).
                    Two original groups made it to the NZ battle of the bands National final in 2012, DAY3 and Logic Defies Logic. Dom, being the only drummer to have this double finalist feat, was awarded as a stand out drummer in the competition by Dave Morello.
                    Dave assisted with production and gear for two demanding recording sessions that DAY3 undertook at the prestigious York Street studios in Parnell later that year.
                    Dom's other dedicated original project, Set The Cycle, recorded at York Street the following year for their single, Parables. As well as recorded drums, he also performed studio recorded grand piano for the York street sessions mentioned above.

                    <br>
                    In July of 2014, Dom relocated to Melbourne with Logic Defies Logic, committed to the quality of one group over the many. Throughout 2014-2020 "Logic" played many tours
                    through Victoria, the Australian East coast and New Zealand. Always keen to push themselves further, the powerful progressive-groove quartet toured Japan in February/March 2020,
                    and finished with two shows in Melbourne before lockdown took effect. LDL recorded 3 albums in their time together, plus multiple single releases and many music videos.
                    Check out their work on YouTube and Spotify/Bandcamp.

                    After the sudden loss of her loved son in February 2022 Beck's has chosen to step away from the day to day running of the business
                    to be closer to her children and grandson. Residing in the Tasman Bay, Becks remains actively involved in Maya Music from a far.

                    Martin originates from the Isles of Scilly where he started his musical career at age 9 singing in his first band ‘No Pulse’. When the original drummer had to leave the-->
                    islands to attend college, Martin said “I’ll give the drums a go too!”.
                    <br><br>
                    Realising he was much better suited to drumming than singing, No Pulse found a replacement singer and the rest is history…
                    Fast forward to 2012, Martin received a Bachelor with honours degree in popular music, with a focus on music performance, after which he decided to travel to the world.
                    In March of 2014, Martin found himself in Queenstown and fell in love with the town - and the music scene - quickly establishing himself as one of the town’s most sought after
                    drummers.
                    When not teaching at Maya, he can be seen playing all manner of gigs from the corner of the local bar, all the way to being on stage at the memorial hall in full
                    musical productions, with a number of weddings and corporate gigs squeezed in between for good measure!
